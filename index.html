            <h1>Lawler middle school</h1>
            <p>Lawler Middle School sits on the site of what was part of the extensive Lawler farm, owned by Roger Lawler, longtime Frisco resident and landowner. In 2014, he and his wife, Jody, gifted the Frisco Education Foundation with $1 million to endow scholarship funds for students who would not otherwise be able to attend college due to financial hardship. Lawler was born near Ben Wheeler Texas. When he was 16 he enlisted in the Navy just after World War II and was assigned to a submarine based at Pearl Harbor. He also joined the Marine Corps during the Korean War and was shipped overseas as a member of the Black Sheep Squadron. In between the wars, he attended both the University of Texas at Arlington and Southern Methodist University. Upon his return to Texas, he worked at United Airlines and NASA. In the 1960’s, he bought a farm in Frisco and continued to be successful buying and selling land. His support of educational opportunities has touched many.</p>

            <h2>Chaitra Thummala</h2>
            <p>Congratulations to incoming Lawler Middle School seventh grader Chaitra Thummala, who finished second at the 2021 Scripps National Spelling Bee.

Thummala moved to Frisco earlier this summer from the San Francisco Bay Area. While she is new to the city and FISD, she is not new to spelling competitions. 

“I found a passion for spelling when I won my first spelling bee in kindergarten,” Thummala said. “I correctly spelled the word alfalfa!”

Thummala is already settling into her new home and is happy to be reconnecting with friends who also moved here. While some things are different in Texas, her passion for her studies has not been deterred by the move.

“I am already studying for my next spelling bee,” Thummala said. “I review lots of word lists and books put out by previous finalists in the National Bee.”

Thummala, who mostly studies with her mom, finds the words that don’t follow the general language rules to be the most interesting and explains that it’s those that she focuses on memorizing.

She first competed in the Scripps Spelling Bee in the fourth grade and wasn’t nervous when it came to going to the National Bee.

“It’s thrilling to compete,” she said. “However, I would regularly pause to remind myself that I was proud of getting that far in the competition, no matter what place I got.”

While her hopes were dashed this year with the misspelling of “Neroli oil,” an essential oil produced from the blossom of the bitter orange tree, there is no doubt that Thummala is not done yet.

“I just keep studying almost every day,” Thummala said. “I would encourage anyone interested in delving deep into spelling to work hard because it’s only a matter of time until you reach your goal.”

Thummala enjoys playing tennis in her free time and wants to go into the medical field upon high school graduation.

Congratulations to Thummala on her second-place finish. Lawler Middle School and FISD look forward to welcoming her to campus and cheering her on in upcoming competitions!</p>

                <h4>Proof of residency</h4>
                <img src="https://www.friscoisd.org/images/default-source/department-headers/photo_group.jpg"  class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Frisco ISD requires families provide proof of residency each year as a final step in the annual registration process. For the 2021-2022 school year, all FISD campuses will utilize an online submission process through a LaserFiche form for proof of residence across all campus levels. This program is intended to reduce paper waste, improve accuracy and save time for both parents and campus staff. If you have more than one student attending FISD, you will need to submit proof of residency for each student individually. Once submitted, your proof of residency will be reviewed by campus staff to verify it meets the acceptable proof of Requirements below. If it is not accepted, you will be contacted for further information. A copy of a current (current or previous month) utility bill (electric, gas or water) which shows the current usage on it. A current lease (for 30 days until a utility bill is available). If you have recently purchased your home, a copy of the closing papers will suffice until a utility bill is available to reproduce (within 30 days). If you are living with a relative or friend in the FISD attendance zone, an affidavit must be completed, notarized and returned to the school office along with a current utility bill. Students living apart from parents—Refer to Policy FDB (LOCAL). Have a Proof of Residency Ready to Upload?  The form will officially open for 2021-22 submissions on May ​3.  Submit your Proof of Residency. While the electronic process is preferred, FISD campuses will continue to accept proof of residency in-person.  Please contact the campus directly for alternate submission options. Please note the enrollment process will not be complete until this documentation has been received. Students will not receive course enrollment information until it has been provided. Students who are unable to produce documentation to verify residency in the Frisco ISD attendance zone may not be able to attend a Frisco ISD school and will be subject to withdrawal. Residence requires living in the district and having the present intention to remain there. Please refer to the Laserfiche Online Proof of Residence Guardian FAQs for further assistance. Presenting a false record or falsifying records is an offense under Section 37.10, Penal code, and enrollment of the child under false documents subjects the person to liability for tuition or other costs. TEC Sec. 25.002(3)(d).</p>
